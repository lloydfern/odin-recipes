    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>This recipe will show you how to make the classic home cooking
        recipe that everybody loves. It might not be like mama used to
        make but fuck her she's <strong>DEAD.</strong> </p>

     <p>Sorry about that my relationship with my mother really fell
        in the latter stages of her dementia. Anyhoo we are making
        lasagna. Don't count the calories and enjoy this layered 
        miasma of cheese, tomato, beef and pasta.
     </p>   

     <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
     <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat 
            to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, 
            and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor 
            of the sauce.</li> 
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li> 
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
        </li>  
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut 
            into it.</li>
    </ul>
