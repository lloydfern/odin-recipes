    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Now I don't know about you but nothing screams I've lost the sense of
        what is necessary in life than eating a salad. Now who else do we think about
        when this joyful topic comes to mind? That's right white middle class people.

    <p>This brings me onto todays topic of conversation the Strawberry Spinach Salad. Don't
        worry it's as pretentious as it sounds. Perfect to bring to your next garden party to
        show up all the other out of touch white people. Especially Shannon the uppety bitch.
        It even has toasted walnuts just to splash in some environmental damage. It's not like
        all the earths drinkable water is very rapidly decreasing.
